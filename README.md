# Digital-Logic-Design-Course
This course mostly concentrate on basic logic circuits design and expresses rules to simplify logical equations using algorithm such as truth-table , tree-diagrams and karnaugh map . furthermore projects provide basic knowledge to implement logic circuits in modelsim software and also help us to understand functionality of circuits using analyze the source signals and waveform outputs. finally we become familiar with simple block synthesization in quartus environment.
