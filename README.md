# Digital-Logic-Design-Course
This course mostly concentrate on basic logic circuits and how we can express rules to simplify a logical equation using algorithm such as truth-table , tree-diagrams and karnaugh map . in case of course projects those provide basic knowledge to implement logic circuits in modelsim software and also help us to understand functionality of circuits using investigate the source signals in waveform outputs finally we fimilar with simple block syntesicing in quartus environment.
